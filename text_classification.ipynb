    "**Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) measures the proportion of true positive instances that were actually identified correctly from all the actual positive samples in the dataset.** It is important when it is critical to find all positive instances, such as in fraud detection where missing a fraudulent transaction could be costly."
